<h1> shopify.project </h1>
<h3>My first HTML-CSS project after 1 week of full stack course</h3>

this is the first project I made in web development, its a simple HTML-CSS project for a shopping website, I made this project only one week into learning coding and i didn't use any external library like bootstrap.
